    Two
When you import the library Two is a window level class that serves as the main interaction point for the project. It exposes a number of methods and properties. These make it possible to draw, but also afford other capabilities such as augmenting the drawing space. Below are the documented properties and features of the Two class. Unless specified methods return their instance of Two for the purpose of chaining.
construction var two = new Two(params);

Create a new instance of Two where params is a JavaScript object with several optional parameters listed below:

type params.type

Set the type of renderer for the instance: svg, webgl, canvas, etc.. Applicable types are carried within Two.Types. Default type is Two.Types.svg.

width params.width

Set the width of the drawing space. Disregarded if params.fullscreen is set to true. Default width is 640 pixels.

height params.height

Set the height of the drawing space. Disregarded if params.fullscreen is set to true. Default height is 480 pixels.

autostart params.autostart

A boolean to automatically add the instance to draw on requestAnimationFrame. This is a convenient substitute so you don't have to call two.play().

fullscreen params.fullscreen

A boolean to set the drawing space of the instance to be fullscreen or not. If set to true then width and height parameters will not be respected.

ratio params.ratio

Set the resolution ratio for canvas and webgl renderers. If left blank two.js automatically infers the ratio based on the devicePixelRatio api.

type two.type

A string representing which type of renderer the instance has implored.

frameCount two.frameCount

A number representing how many frames have elapsed.

timeDelta two.timeDelta

A number representing how much time has elapsed since the last frame in milliseconds.

width two.width

The width of the instance's dom element.

height two.height

The height of the instance's dom element.

playing two.playing

A boolean representing whether or not the instance is being updated through the automatic requestAnimationFrame.

renderer two.renderer

The instantiated rendering class for the instance. For a list of possible rendering types check out Two.Types.

scene two.scene

The base level Two.Group which houses all objects for the instance. Because it is a Two.Group transformations can be applied to it that will affect all objects in the instance. This is handy as a makeshift camera.

appendTo two.appendTo(domElement);

A convenient method to append the instance's dom element to the page. It's required to add the instance's dom element to the page in order to see anything drawn.

play two.play();

This method adds the instance to the requestAnimationFrame loop. In affect enabling animation for this instance.

pause two.pause();

This method removes the instance from the requestAnimationFrame loop. In affect halting animation for this instance.

update two.update();

This method updates the dimensions of the drawing space, increments the tick for animation, and finally calls two.render(). When using the built-in requestAnimationFrame hook, two.play(), this method is invoked for you automatically.

render two.render();

This method makes the instance's renderer draw. It should be unnecessary to invoke this yourself at anytime.

add two.add(objects);

Add one or many shapes / groups to the instance. Objects can be added as arguments, two.add(o1, o2, oN), or as an array depicted above.

remove two.remove(objects);

Remove one or many shapes / groups from the instance. Objects can be removed as arguments, two.remove(o1, o2, oN), or as an array depicted above.

clear two.clear();

Removes all objects from the instance's scene. If you intend to have the browser garbage collect this, don't forget to delete the references in your application as well.

makeLine two.makeLine(x1, y1, x2, y2);

Draws a line between two coordinates to the instance's drawing space where x1, y1 are the x, y values for the first coordinate and x2, y2 are the x, y values for the second coordinate. It returns a Two.Line object.

makeRectangle two.makeRectangle(x, y, width, height);

Draws a rectangle to the instance's drawing space where x, y are the x, y values for the center point of the rectangle and width, height represents the width and height of the rectangle. It returns a Two.Rectangle object.

makeRoundedRectangle two.makeRoundedRectangle(x, y, width, height, radius);

Draws a rounded rectangle to the instance's drawing space where x, y are the x, y values for the center point of the rectangle and width, height represents the width and height of the rectangle. Lastly, the radius parameter defines what the miter radius of the rounded corner is. It returns a Two.RoundedRectangle object.

makeCircle two.makeCircle(x, y, radius);

makeEllipse two.makeEllipse(x, y, width, height);

Draws an ellipse to the instance's drawing space where x, y are the x, y values for the center point of the ellipse and width, height are the dimensions of the ellipse. It returns a Two.Ellipse object.

makeStar two.makeStar(ox, oy, or, ir, sides);

Draws a star to the instance's drawing space where ox, oy are the x, y values for the center point of the star and or, ir are the outer and inner radii for the star, and sides are how many points the star has. It returns a Two.Star object.

makePolygon two.makePolygon(ox, oy, r, sides);

Draws a polygon to the instance's drawing space where ox, oy are the x, y values for the center of the polygon, r is the radius, and sides are how many sides the polygon has. It returns a Two.Polygon object.

makeArcSegment two.makeArcSegment(ox, oy, ir, or, sa, ea, res);

Draws an arc segment from center point ox, oy with an inner and outer radius of ir, or. Lastly, you need to supply a start and ending angle sa, ea. Optionally, pass the resolution for how many points on the arc are desired. It returns a Two.ArcSegment object.

makeCurve two.makeCurve(x1, y1, x2, y2, xN, yN, open);

Draws a curved path to the instance's drawing space. The arguments are a little tricky. It returns a Two.Path object.

The method accepts any amount of paired x, y values as denoted by the series above. It then checks to see if there is a final argument, a boolean open, which marks whether or not the shape should be open. If true the curve will have two clear endpoints, otherwise it will be closed.

This method also recognizes the format two.makeCurve(points, open) where points is an array of Two.Anchor's and open is an optional boolean describing whether or not to expose endpoints. It is imperative if you generate curves this way to make the list of points Two.Anchor's.

makePath two.makePath(x1, y1, x2, y2, xN, yN, open);

Draws a path to the instance's drawing space. The arguments are a little tricky. It returns a Two.Path object.

The method accepts any amount of paired x, y values as denoted by the series above. It then checks to see if there is a final argument, a boolean open, which marks whether or not the shape should be open. If true the path will have two clear endpoints, otherwise it will be closed.

This method also recognizes the format two.makePath(points, open) where points is an array of Two.Anchor's and open is an optional boolean describing whether or not to expose endpoints. It is imperative if you generate curves this way to make the list of points Two.Anchor's.

 The Two.Path that this method creates is the base shape for all of the make functions.

makeGroup two.makeGroup(objects);

Adds a group to the instance's drawing space. While a group does not have any visible features when rendered it allows for nested transformations on shapes. See Two.Group for more information. It accepts an array of objects, Two.Paths or Two.Groups. As well as a list of objects as the arguments, two.makeGroup(o1, o2, oN). It returns a Two.Group object.

interpret two.interpret(svgNode);

Reads an svg node and draws the svg object by creating Two.Paths and Two.Groups from the reference. It then adds it to the instance's drawing space. It returns a Two.Group object.

bind two.bind(event, callback);

Bind an event, string, to a callback function. Passing "all" will bind the callback to all events. Inherited from Backbone.js.

unbind two.unbind(event, callback);

Remove one or many callback functions. If callback is null it removes all callbacks for an event. If the event name is null, all callback functions for the instance are removed. This is highly discouraged. Inherited from Backbone.js.

Properties Two.Properties

A list of renderer specific application properties.

Events Two.Events

A list of actionable events triggered by a given instance. For the most part these are internal events in order to enable two-way databinding. Exceptions include update event on animation loop and resize when the dimensions of the drawing space change. Related to two.bind and two.trigger.

Commands Two.Commands

A list of commands that dictate how the various renderers draw Two.Anchors.

Resolution Two.Resolution

A number representing how many subdivisions should be present during curve calculations.

Utils Two.Utils

A collection of utility functions and variables used throughout the project. This is where much of the algorithmic computation lies: computing curve handles, subdividing cubic bezier curves, interpretting svg nodes. Because of its complexity it's encouraged to look at the source code for further information.

Error Two.Error(message);

A two.js specific custom error handler. Takes a message, string, to display in the console to developers.

Two.Path
This is the base class for creating all drawable shapes in two.js. Unless specified methods return their instance of Two.Path for the purpose of chaining.
construction var path = new Two.Path(vertices, closed, curved, manual);

A path takes an array of vertices which are made up of Two.Anchors. This is essential for the two-way databinding. It then takes two booleans, closed and curved which delineate whether the shape should be closed (lacking endpoints) and whether the shape should calculate curves or straight lines between the vertices. Finally, manual is an optional argument if you'd like to override the default behavior of two.js and handle anchor positions yourself. Generally speaking, this isn't something you need to deal with, although some great usecases arise from this customability, e.g: advanced curve manipulation.

 If you are constructing groups this way instead of two.makePath(), then don't forget to add the group to the instance's scene, two.add(group).

id path.id

The id of the path. In the svg renderer this is the same number as the id attribute given to the corresponding node. i.e: if path.id = 4 then document.querySelector('#two-' + group.id) will return the corresponding svg node.

noFill path.noFill();

Removes the fill.

noStroke path.noStroke();

Removes the stroke.

plot path.plot();

If curved goes through the vertices and calculates the curve. If not, then goes through the vertices and calculates the lines.

subdivide path.subdivide();

MakeObservable Two.Path.MakeObservable(obj);

Convenience method to make getter / setter properties specific to Two.Path.

Two.Line
This is a class for creating a line in two.js. It inherits from Two.Path, so it has all the same properties and functions as Two.Path.

A rectangle takes a set of x, y coordinates as its origin (the center of the rectangle by default) and width, height parameters to define the width and height of the rectangle.

Two.RoundedRectangle
This is a class for creating a rounded rectangle in two.js. It inherits from Two.Path, so it has all the same properties and functions as Two.Path.
construction var roundedRect = new Two.RoundedRectangle(x, y, width, height, radius);

A rounded rectangle takes a set of x, y coordinates as its origin (the center of the rounded rectangle by default) and width, height parameters to define the width and height of the rectangle. Lastly, it takes an optional radius number representing the radius of the curve along the corner of the rectangle. radius defaults to 1/12th the of the smaller value between width, height.

construction var ellipse = new Two.Ellipse(x, y, width, height);

An ellipse takes a set of x, y coordinates as its origin (the center of the ellipse by default) and width, height parameters to define the width and height of the ellipse.

 To construct a circle leave height empty and the height will default to the width.

Two.Star
This is a class for creating a star in two.js. It inherits from Two.Path, so it has all the same properties and functions as Two.Path.
construction var star = new Two.Star(x, y, or, ir, sides);

A star takes a set of x, y coordinates as its origin (the center of the star by default) and or parameter to define the outer radius of the star. Optionally you can define an ir inner radius for the star and sides for how many sides the star has. By default he ir is half the or and there are 5 sides.

Two.Polygon
This is a class for creating a polygon, symmetrically multi-sided shape, in two.js. It inherits from Two.Path, so it has all the same properties and functions as Two.Path.
construction var polygon = new Two.Polygon(x, y, radius, sides);

A polygon takes a set of x, y coordinates as its origin (the center of the polygon by default) and radius, sides parameters to define the radius of the polygon and how many sides the polygon has. By default there are 3 sides, a triangle.

 Prior to two.js v0.5.0 Two.Polygon acted as the base drawing class. What Two.Path effectively is after v0.5.0.

Two.Group
This is a container object for two.js — it can hold shapes as well as other groups. At a technical level it can be considered an empty transformation matrix. It is recommended to use two.makeGroup() in order to add groups to your instance of two, but it's not necessary. Unless specified methods return their instance of Two.Group for the purpose of chaining.
construction var group = new Two.Group();

 If you are constructing groups this way instead of two.makeGroup(), then don't forget to add the group to the instance's scene, two.add(group).

Two.Vector
This is the atomic coordinate representation for two.js. A Two.Vector is different and specific to two.js because its main properties, x and y, trigger events which allow the renderers to efficiently change only when they need to.

Two.Anchor
Taken from the Adobe Illustrator nomenclature a Two.Anchor represents an anchor point in two.js. This class delineates to the renderer what action to take when plotting points. It inherits all properties and methods from Two.Vector. As a result, Two.Anchor can be used as such. Depending on its command, anchor points may or may not have corresponding control points to describe how their bezier curves should be rendered.
construction var anchor = new Two.Anchor(x, y, lx, ly, rx, ry, command);

A Two.Anchor can take initial positions of x and y to orient the point. lx and ly describe where the left control point will reside. Likewise rx and ry describe where the right control point will reside. Finally, the command describes what action the renderer will take once rendering. A more detailed description of commands can be found on the w3c and the available commands in two.js can be found under Two.Commands.

 Two.Anchor is introduced to two.js as of v0.3.0

x anchor.x

The x value of the anchor's position.

y anchor.y

The y value of the anchor's position.

command anchor.command

The command for the given anchor.

controls anchor.controls

An object that exists only when anchor.command is Two.Commands.curve. It holds the anchor's control point Two.Vectors and describes what the make up of the curve will be.

right anchor.controls.right

A Two.Vector that represents the position of the control point to the “right” of the anchor's position. To further clarify, if you were to orient the anchor so that it was normalized and facing up, this control point would be to the right of it.

left anchor.controls.left

A Two.Vector that represents the position of the control point to the “left” of the anchor's position. To further clarify, if you were to orient the anchor so that it was normalized and facing up, this control point would be to the left of it.

clone anchor.clone();

Returns a new instance of a Two.Anchor with the same x, y, controls, and command values as the instance.

listen anchor.listen();

Convenience method to add event bubbling to an attached path.

ignore anchor.ignore();

Convenience method to remove event bubbling to an attached path.

AppendCurveProperties Anchor.AppendCurveProperties();

Convenience method to add the controls object.

Two.Stop
This is a class for defining how gradients are colored in two.js. By itself a Two.Stop doesn't render anything specifically to the screen.
construction var stop = new Two.Stop(offset, color, opacity);

A stop takes a 0 to 1 offset value which defines where on the trajectory of the gradient the full color is rendered. It also takes a color which is a css string representing the color value and an optional opacity which is also a 0 to 1 value.

offset stop.offset

A 0 to 1 offset value which defines where on the trajectory of the gradient the full color is rendered.

color stop.color

A css string that represents the color of the stop.

opacity stop.opacity

A 0 to 1 value which defines the opacity of the stop.

 This only renders in the Two.Types.svg mode.

clone stop.clone();

Clones a stop. Returns a new Two.Stop.

Two.LinearGradient
This is a class for creating a LinearGradient in two.js. By itself a Two.LinearGradient doesn't render anything specifically to the screen. However, in conjunction with a Two.Path you can style Two.Path.fill or Two.Path.stroke with a Two.LinearGradient to render a gradient for that part of the Two.Path. Check the examples page for exact usage.
construction var linearGradient = new Two.LinearGradient(x1, y1, x2, y2, stops);

A linear gradient takes two sets of x, y coordinates to define the endpoints of the styling. These coordinates are relative to the origin of a Two.Path. This typically means you'll want to go from a negative quadrant to a positive quadrant in order for the gradient to render correctly. Lastly it takes an array of Two.Stops which represent the color value along the gradient's trajectory.

left linearGradient.left

A Two.Vector that represents the position of the x, y coordinates to the “left” of the gradient's two end points.

right linearGradient.right

A Two.Vector that represents the position of the x, y coordinates to the “right” of the gradient's two end points.

clone linearGradient.clone();

A function to clone a linearGradient. Also, clones each Two.Stop in the linearGradient.stops array.

Two.RadialGradient
This is a class for creating a RadialGradient in two.js. By itself a Two.RadialGradient doesn't render anything specifically to the screen. However, in conjunction with a Two.Path you can style Two.Path.fill or Two.Path.stroke with a Two.RadialGradient to render a gradient for that part of the Two.Path. Check the examples page for exact usage.
construction var radialGradient = new Two.radialGradient(x, y, radius, stops, fx, fy);

A radial gradient takes a set of x, y coordinates to define the center of the styling. These coordinates are relative to the origin of a Two.Path. This typically means you'll want to set these to 0, 0. Next define how large the radius for the radial gradient is. Lastly, pass an array of Two.Stops to define the coloring of the radial gradient. Optionally, you can pass a set of x, y coordinates to define the focal position of the radial gradient's trajectory.

center radialGradient.center

A Two.Vector that represents the position of the x, y coordinates at the center of the gradient.

radius radialGradient.radius

A number representing the radius of the radialGradient.

focal linearGradient.focal

A Two.Vector that represents the position of the x, y coordinates as the focal point for the gradient's trajectory.

spread radialGradient.spread

Defines how the gradient is rendered by the renderer. For more details see the w3c svg spec.

stops radialGradient.stops

A Two.Utils.Collection of Two.Stops that is two-way databound. Individual stops may be manipulated.

clone radialGradient.clone();

A function to clone a radialGradient. Also, clones each Two.Stop in the radialGradient.stops array.

Two.Text
This is a class for creating, manipulating, and rendering text dynamically in Two.js. As such it is rather primitive. You can use custom fonts through @Font Face spec. However, you do not have control over the glyphs themselves. If you'd like to mainpulate that specifically it is recommended to use SVG Interpreter. A text object extends Two.Shape.
construction var text = new Two.Text(message, x, y, styles);

A text object takes in a message, the string representation of what will be displayed. It then takes an x and y number where the text object will be placed in the group. Finally, an optional styles object to apply any other additional styles. Applicable properties to affect can be found in Two.Text.Properties.

value text.value

A string representing the text that will be rendered to the stage.

family text.family
